# Note-taking console application
This is my first attempt writing a console application where on can write, read and delete notes. 
# Behind the scenes
This project does nothing more than creating a .txt file in the working directory. 
When taking a new note, a new line will be appended in this file. And so on. 
When listing all notes, the program simply iterates through all lines of the .txt file and displays them on the console with its index. 
When deleting one or more notes, all notes will be displayed with its index again, and the user can choose wether he wants to delete one specific
note by its index or all notes.
# Conclusion
NoTe, that this is just a practise project. It does nothing special and one shouldn't take this as a reference for anything.
